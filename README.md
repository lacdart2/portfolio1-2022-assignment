## Description

this is a portfolio for presenting three of my previous projects with noroff in the first year
these projects were supplied with readme.md files in each root , presenting the process of developing and the choices i made is important as a web developer .

these projects are :

- project exam 1
- semester project 1
- course assignment

i even went back to my old code and changed it a bit to fit what i have learned so far.

# Choice of layout

the website is straight to the point in terms of design and layout
from top to bottom :

- navigation with a blinking logo on the left and hamburger menu on the right, i kept it even in large devices layout.

- a short presentation of my self with an hight height image on the right.
- my process so far section : to present my status of student at noroff.
- some data regarding my study and what i have accomplished so far.
- fixing the past section :is my way to say looking back to old code and fix what should be fixed.
- my work presented in three card in a column
- each card has a screenshot with a scroll reveal option, this is somethign extra, but i wanted to try this feature after watching some tutorials
- i used also the fix to top sticky heady when scrolling feature that i saw previously in airbnb website.
- links to my the github repo and the live site on the side of the project screen shot
- contact page with form validation features.
- footer with social media links.

# Choice of colors and images

i choosed a Monochromatic Color Palettes, to keep things simple and lightweight.
regarding the layout i wanted to play a bit with negative space in the top section of the webstite, and the bottom one. it was a bit risky then i spliced a bit some parts of the negative space.

regarding images i used only the projects screenshots and my onw profile image.
